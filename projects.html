        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My full name is Christopher Aidan Kim but I've always been called by my middle name, Aidan. Just a personal preference of mine. I've been programming for almost two years now and mainly focusing on Front-End Web Development. I believe completing the FEWD Techdegree will allow me to reach my goal to write beautiful and simple code.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding away, I really enjoy team sports like basketball, hockey, football and many more. I recently incorporated DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports) into my life. Staying active and healthy is very important to me. I am also into gaming mostly playing Overwatch but slowly transitioning into Apex Legends.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be able to be fluent in Front-End Web Development to build beautiful websites and webapps. My goal is to keep increasing my skills in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My goal is to combine DFS (Daily Fantasty Sports) and programming to create a product that everyone in the market can benefit from and use.</p>
        <p>I am eager to show anyone who stumbles across this page my abliities to write code and one day, help someone with their needs or wants.</p>
