        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My full name is Christopher Aidan Kim but I've always been called by my middle name, Aidan. Just a personal preference of mine. I've been programming for almost two years now and mainly focusing on Front-End Web Development. I believe completing the FEWD Techdegree will allow me to reach my goal to write beautiful and simple code.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding away, I really enjoy team sports like basketball, hockey and many more. Staying active and healthy is very important to me. I am also into gaming mostly playing Overwatch but slowly transitioning into Apex Legends.</p>
